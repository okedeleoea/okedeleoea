👋 Hi, I’m Olanrewaju Emmanuel Okedele
Cybersecurity Analyst | SOC & Detection Engineering | Cloud Security (GCP)
📍 Ontario-focused | Open to Junior SOC / Cybersecurity Analyst roles
🛡️ About Me
I’m a cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in cloud-native security operations, SIEM detection engineering, and incident analysis.
My focus is on practical, hands-on learning—turning real attack simulations into detections, alerts, and incident reports that mirror how modern SOC teams operate, especially in Google Security Operations (Chronicle) and cloud environments.
I document my work rigorously to demonstrate how attacks surface in logs, how controls prevent impact, and how analysts investigate and close incidents.
🔧 Core Skills
SOC & Detection: Log analysis, alert tuning, threat hunting, incident response
Cloud Security: Google Cloud IAM, Security Command Center, Cloud Logging, DLP
SIEM Platforms: Google Security Operations (Chronicle), Elastic (foundational)
Automation: Python (log parsing, anomaly detection, enrichment), Bash (basic)
Security Concepts: MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF, CD/CR, least privilege
Tools: Nmap, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Kali Linux, Git
🏅 Certifications & Training
Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
Google Cloud Cybersecurity Certificate
IBM Cybersecurity Breaches Case Studies & Capstone Project
Google Security Operations – Fundamentals (Chronicle platform)
Google Security Operations – Deep Dive (advanced detections & tuning)
Google Modern Security Operations (Autonomic SecOps, CD/CR) (ongoing)
Microsoft Python Programming for Development (in progress)
🚀 Featured Projects
Quality over quantity. Each project is SOC-style, documented, and defensible.
🔍 Network Discovery Lab (SOC Perspective)
Repo: network-discovery-lab
Simulated internal reconnaissance and credential misuse
Validated firewall controls blocking lateral movement (SMB)
Built Elastic KQL detections
Wrote a full SOC incident report
Skills: Detection engineering, log analysis, incident documentation
📊 SIEM Detection Engineering Lab (in progress)
Focus: SIEM-first alerts (no exploitation noise)
Brute-force login detection
Suspicious PowerShell execution
Alert thresholds & false positive discussion
☁️ Google Cloud Security Labs
Security Command Center threat findings
IAM least privilege enforcement
Cloud DLP redaction
Secure VPC & private services
🐍 Python Threat Hunting
Log anomaly detection using pandas & Isolation Forest
Automated parsing of failed logins and suspicious activity
🧠 How I Work
Cloud-first, low-resource labs (no heavy VM dependency)
Detection > exploitation
Logs → alerts → investigation → report
Everything documented with screenshots, queries, and lessons learned
